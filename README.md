# Ampoule CLI ðŸ’¡

Ampoule CLI is a Rust client for the [ampoule](https://github.com/ldenefle/ampoule) project. 

Right now it only supports blinking a LED over a serial device and is aimed at testing the implementation.

The device module is designed to be fairly extensible and can support any Transport that implements the traits Read, Write and Send.
